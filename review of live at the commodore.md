Aaron Chapman
Vancouver: Arsenal Pulp Press, 2014. 206 pp. Large Format. $28.95

From the beginning, Aaron Chapman is clear about his intentions for *Live at the Commodore: The sotry of Vancouver's Historical Commodore Ballroom*. The renowned Granville Street concert venue is a place where "The history of the room is the history of how Vancouver has entertained itself" (11). Chapman's coffee table-sized book is full of pictures of the ballroom's past, present, and future; coupled with scattered concert ephemera and paraphernalia, the anecdotes Chapman collects speak loudly to the cultural history that has passed through the doors of this venerable Vancouver institution. 

Beginning with a brief history of Vancouver itself, Chapman sets the historical scene of 1920s Vancouver into which the Commodore was born. Referencing the shifting landscape of Granville Street, Chapman moves chronologically through the Commodore's early days alternately thriving and hibernating in the pre and post depression era's milieu of wealth and high society through to bootleggers and rough and tumble blue-collar workers who were entertained on the ballroom's sprung floor. In short, the book follows the trajectory of Vancouver's coming of age with all its vices, sins, and establishment figures. 

Combining the visual scope and presentation qualities of a good coffee table book with an in-depth cultural history, the book rests at key junctures in both the ballroom's history and Vancouver's, but it never lingers, moving quickly to the next representative figure, cultural scene, or musical act that might serve as an exemplar of the Commodore's significant historical value.  

The book might be accused of replying too heavily on anecdote after it leaves the confines of the pre-1950s cultural scene and moves into a prolonged survey of the period between the mid-1960s and the late 1980s. That said, some of the book's more colourful tales come at this juncture. Pictures of Kiss playing, with all their makeup, attitude, and high booted style, to an audience of less than 1000 and Nirvana's debut before the chainsaw of grunge had fully felled the tree are both representative examples of how Chapman's book underscores the role cultural institutions such as the Commodore play in anointing, supporting, and facilitating shifting cultural moments.   

Given its reliance on the story or reportage, the book could be accused of lacking a substantive or critical level that encourages distance or critical reflection upon the specific relevance of the Commodore Ballroom to some the numerous societal changes that swirled around the venue. Suffice to say, Chapman relies more on the Commodore Ballroom as metonym for cultural and social change rather than as metaphor.

Finally, there is a prevailing sense of loss in the book. A tone that suggests things are not the same as they used to be and that the Commodore's days are numbered even as its doors remain open. To this end, the book is a wonderful example of the odd dichotomy that permeates histories of buildings: there is a tendency to lament the loss of something that is still there. The ephemera the book collects, both through text and image, while certainly referencing the ballroom, speak more to the different socio-cultural eras hosted by the Commodore's dance floor. To that end, Chapman undoubtably accomplishes what he sets out to do, the stories about the entertainment history of Vancouver are echoed by the walls of the Commodore Ballroom.
