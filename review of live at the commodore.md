Review of *Live at the Commodore: The Story of Vancouver's Historic Commodore Ballroom*
Aaron Chapman
Due: Nov. 1, 2015

First Glance: 

- Large-format book, meant to be browsed as a picture book and the pics are cool, but there's quite a bit of repetition and a lack of context for some of the pictures. 
- Many anecdotal tales rather than historical analysis or critique; this would function best as a coffee-table book for those who might share a history with the Commodore. 
- funny to see KISS going all out, flames, spitting fire, makeup and whatnot in such a small venue
- Something about the book is empty, like there are gaps in something, or that the Commodore itself cannot actually live up to the historical hype - what of all the other venues in the region of Granville upon which the Commodore sits (Orpheum, Capital Theatre) - the history of the neighbourhood with its ethnic diversity isn't addressed... "The blue-collar quote..."
- Better as part of a more comprehensive history of the area rather than a singularly-focused history of the Commodore
- The anecdotes are strung together like story time... a kind of "you shulda BEEN there" feel, but the acts do not necessarily live up tot he hype... this isn't the Hollywood Bowl.
