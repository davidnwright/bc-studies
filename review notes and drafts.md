LIVE at the Commodore - Review Notes

Review of *Live at the Commodore: The Story of Vancouver's Historic Commodore Ballroom*
Aaron Chapman
Due: Nov. 1, 2015

First Glance: 

- Large-format book, meant to be browsed as a picture book and the pics are cool, but there's quite a bit of repetition and a lack of context for some of the pictures. 
- Many anecdotal tales rather than historical analysis or critique; this would function best as a coffee-table book for those who might share a history with the Commodore. 
- funny to see KISS going all out, flames, spitting fire, makeup and whatnot in such a small venue
- Something about the book is empty, like there are gaps in something, or that the Commodore itself cannot actually live up to the historical hype - what of all the other venues in the region of Granville upon which the Commodore sits (Orpheum, Capital Theatre) - the history of the neighbourhood with its ethnic diversity isn't addressed... "The blue-collar quote..."
- Better as part of a more comprehensive history of the area rather than a singularly-focused history of the Commodore
- The anecdotes are strung together like story time... a kind of "you shulda BEEN there" feel, but the acts do not necessarily live up tot he hype... this isn't the Hollywood Bowl. 

Second Glances in Sentence Format:

Aaron Chapman's book beings with the following dclaration: "The history of the room is the history of how Vancouver has entertained itself [almost from the beginning]" (11). Almost from the beginning is for this book on or about 1920. 

The book's overall tone is one that longs for a time gone by, one lost to urban development and shifting cultural practices. 

The book, despite it's opening salvo above, is less about the Commodore Ballroom than about the cultural and musical melieu that walked through its doors. That said, there's certainly a robust cataloguing of the Commodore's architectural history and the structures that surrounded it. 

Beginning with a brief history of Vancouver itself, Chapman sets the historical scene of 1920s Vancouver into which the Commodore was born. The book highlights that differences between now and then by referencing the shifting landscape of Granville Street. 

The book is both a coffee table book and in-depth cultural history, roughly following the trajectory of Vancouver's growth from backwater to international city. 

The is a tendency toward anecdote, which is understandable given the recorded history nature of the book's scenes. The anedotes are part of the book's charm and perhaps, on another level, the book's biggest flaw. At times, the book lacks a substantive or critical level that suggestions reflection upon its stories and their relevance to the Commodore Ballroom itself as a cultural metaphor rather than gathering space for culture itself. There is also sometimes a distinct lack of a substantive critical eye on the cultural moments themselves and how they might reflect a more positive development in the future.

There's the prvailing sense of loss in the book--though the COmmodore still stands. It's an odd dichotomy that in histories of buildings, there is a tendency to lament the loss of something that is still there. 

Details around the Commodore's birth, its construction, and its early history is detailed--referencing the dance hall's bouncy floor as integral to the Commodore's early success. 

The book spends much of its time in the 1970s and 1980s.

As with most cultural histories about buildings, Chapman's book is less about the Commodore itself than about the colourful figures and the stories surrounding them than the ballroom itself. That Chapman weaves these stories into a narrative that touches on the cultural history of Vancouver itself and the shifting architectural details about the building itself makes this book an engrossing read. Both distant reader and researcher will benefit from Chapman's robust collection of etheria and stories.

There is no address of race or class here, except to aggrandize the blue-collar element to exploit the ballroom's punk connections or to present the upper-class beginnings of the ballroom as counterpoint to its more seedy current reputation.
